Using /vagrant/ansible.cfg as config file
ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'community.general.seport'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path.

The error appears to be in '/vagrant/ansible/roles/openvpn/tasks/main.yml': line 35, column 3, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


- name: –ó–∞–ø—É—Å–∫ openVPN –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞—Ö
